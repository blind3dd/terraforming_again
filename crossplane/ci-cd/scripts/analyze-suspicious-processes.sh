echo "1. Monitor these specific processes regularly:"

echo "   - Cursor processes (your code editor - legitimate but monitor network usage)"

echo
echo "2. The AWS EC2 connections from Cursor are likely:"
echo "   - Extension marketplace connections"
echo "   - Telemetry/analytics (if enabled)"
echo "   - AI service connections (Cursor's AI features)"
echo
echo "3. The /dev/null redirections are mostly legitimate:"
echo "   - System daemons suppressing routine output"
echo "   - Application processes hiding verbose logging"
echo
echo "4. Continue monitoring with:"
echo "   ./scripts/analyze-devnull-security.sh"
echo "   ./scripts/analyze-suspicious-processes.sh"
echo
echo "=== CONCLUSION ==="
echo "Based on this analysis, your system appears to be running legitimate processes."
echo "The /dev/null redirections and network activity are consistent with normal"
echo "macOS system behavior and legitimate applications (Cursor, OneDrive)."
echo
echo "Continue monitoring, but no immediate security concerns detected."
