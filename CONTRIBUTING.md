   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) model:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   make test
   
   # Run specific test suites
   make test-terraform
   make test-ansible
   make test-helm
   make test-kustomize
   make test-go
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a PR:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
