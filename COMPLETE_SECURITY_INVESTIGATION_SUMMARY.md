### 6. Firewall Configuration (pfctl)
**Firewall Rules Applied:**
```bash
block drop in proto tcp from any to any port = 8021

block drop in proto tcp from any to any port = 21
block drop in proto tcp from any to any port = 69
```

**Status:** Active and blocking suspicious ports

### 7. Browser-Based Attacks
**Malicious Windows Executable:**
- **File:** `setup.exe` (541,464 bytes)

- **Evidence:** Binary files contain suspicious JavaScript patterns
- **Affected Files:** Session backups, YouTube cache, storage files
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Evidence of browser compromise

### 8. Filesystem Mount Detection Vulnerability
**Security Research Finding:**
- **`/etc/fstab` manipulation** - 10 APFS UUID entries added for testing
- **Detection Gap:** `mount` vs `diskutil` discrepancy
- **Vulnerability:** Rootkits could hide mounted volumes from `mount` command
- **Research Purpose:** Testing security tool detection capabilities
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Legitimate security research, demonstrates detection vulnerability
