# Terraform Integration - Fixed!

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

1. **Added "serve" argument**: `terraform.languageServer.args: ["serve"]` - This was required
2. **Removed deprecated settings**: Cleaned up gopls configuration
3. **Extension recommendations**: You can install the recommended extensions

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

### **1. Install Recommended Extensions**
When Cursor asks "Do you want to install the recommended extensions?", click **"Install"** or **"Install All"**. These include:
- Python support (ms-python)
- Other useful extensions for the project

### **2. Reload Window**
After installing extensions:
- Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
- "Developer: Reload Window"

### **3. Test Terraform Navigation**

**Test command-click navigation**:
1. Open `infrastructure/terraform/syntax-test.tf`
2. Try command-click on `aws_s3_bucket.test` - should navigate to definition
3. Try command-click on `aws_s3_bucket` in the resource type - should show documentation

**Test other Terraform features**:
- Open `environments/dev/main.tf`
- Try command-click on module names (e.g., `networking`, `compute`)
- Try command-click on variable references (e.g., `var.region`)

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

✅ **Go**: Command-click works (already working)  
✅ **Terraform**: Command-click should now work for:
- Resource types (`aws_s3_bucket`)
- Data sources (`data.aws_availability_zones`)
- Module references
- Variable references
- Output references

## 🔍 **If Terraform Command-Click Still Doesn't Work**

1. **Check Output Panel**: View → Output → Select "Terraform" for errors
2. **Restart Terraform Language Server**: Command Palette → "Terraform: Restart Language Server"
3. **Verify terraform-ls is running**: Check Output panel for "terraform-ls" messages

## 💡 **About Extension Recommendations**

The recommended extensions are:
- **Python support**: For any Python scripts in the project
- **Other tools**: Various development tools that complement the project

You can safely install them - they won't interfere with Go or Terraform functionality.

The key fix was adding the `"serve"` argument to terraform-ls, which is required for the language server to start properly!
