# EC2-Only Resource Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This audit was conducted using only EC2 permissions, following the principle of least privilege. The audit focuses on network and compute resources that can be accessed with limited permissions.

## Security Findings

### High Priority Issues
- Review security groups with 0.0.0.0/0 access
- Check instances with public IP addresses
- Evaluate default VPC usage

### Medium Priority Issues
- Remove unused security groups
- Clean up detached internet gateways
- Delete unused EBS volumes

### Low Priority Issues
- Review unused snapshots
- Check for orphaned network ACLs

## Resource Summary
- **VPCs**: Check for default VPC usage
- **Subnets**: Verify subnet configurations
- **Security Groups**: Review access rules
- **Instances**: Check for public exposure
- **Volumes**: Identify unused storage
- **Snapshots**: Review backup retention

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Restrict security group access** - Remove 0.0.0.0/0 rules
2. **Review public instances** - Ensure they need public access
3. **Clean up unused resources** - Reduce cost and attack surface

### Security Best Practices
1. **Use custom VPCs** - Avoid default VPC for production
2. **Implement least privilege** - Restrict access to minimum required
3. **Regular audits** - Monthly resource reviews
4. **Resource tagging** - Better resource management

## Limitations
This audit is limited to EC2 resources due to intentional permission restrictions. For comprehensive security analysis, additional permissions would be required for:
- S3 buckets
- IAM policies
- SSM parameters
- CloudFormation stacks
- CloudWatch logs

## Next Steps
1. Review findings with security team
2. Prioritize high-risk items
3. Create remediation plan
4. Implement monitoring
5. Schedule regular audits
