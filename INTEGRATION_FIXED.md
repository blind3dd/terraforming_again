# Go and Terraform Integration - Fixed!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The issue was that the workspace settings got corrupted with Nix environment output mixed in. I've fixed it by copying the working configuration from your `emailai.bkp` project.

### **🔧 What Was Fixed**

1. **Clean Settings**: Removed corrupted Nix output from `.vscode/settings.json`
2. **Proper Go Configuration**: 
   - `go.toolsManagement.enable: false` (like your working project)
   - Correct GOROOT and GOPATH paths
   - Proper gopls configuration
3. **Terraform Configuration**: Clean terraform-ls and tflint paths

### **🧪 Test Now**

1. **Restart Cursor**: Close and reopen Cursor
2. **Test Go**: 
   - Open `applications/go-mysql-api/conff/config.go`
   - Try Command Palette → "Go: Restart Language Server" (should work now!)
   - Check syntax highlighting
3. **Test Terraform**:
   - Open `infrastructure/terraform/syntax-test.tf`
   - Try Command Palette → "Terraform: Restart Language Server"
   - Check syntax highlighting

### **🎯 Expected Results**

✅ **Go**: 
- Keywords colored (package, import, func, etc.)
- Command Palette shows "Go: Restart Language Server"
- IntelliSense works
- Go to definition works

✅ **Terraform**:
- Keywords colored (resource, data, output, etc.)
- Command Palette shows "Terraform: Restart Language Server"
- IntelliSense works
- Command-click navigation works

### **🔍 If Still Not Working**

1. **Reload Window**: Command Palette → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Check Output Panel**: View → Output → Select "Go" or "Terraform"
3. **Verify Extensions**: View → Extensions → Ensure Go and Terraform extensions are installed

The key was matching the working configuration from your `emailai.bkp` project!
