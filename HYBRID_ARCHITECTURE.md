# Hybrid Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the hybrid architecture approach that combines GitHub Actions, Ansible, and ArgoCD to provide a comprehensive infrastructure and application deployment solution.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD, Infrastructure Provisioning, System Hardening
- **Ansible**: System-level Security, Cross-platform Operations, Infrastructure Validation
- **ArgoCD**: Kubernetes Application Management, GitOps Workflows

### 2. **Tool Specialization**
Each tool is used for what it does best:
- GitHub Actions excels at CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native operations
- Ansible excels at system-level configurations and cross-platform operations
- ArgoCD excels at Kubernetes application lifecycle management

### 3. **Security First**
- Security hardening is handled by Ansible for system-level operations
- Security scanning is integrated into GitHub Actions workflows
- Security policies are enforced through ArgoCD and Kubernetes

## Component Responsibilities

- Deployment coordination

#### **Testing & Validation**
- Security scanning (SAST, DAST, container scanning)
- Infrastructure compliance checks
- Performance testing
- Integration testing

### Ansible

#### **System Security Hardening**
- SELinux policy compilation and deployment
- Seccomp profile management
- Cross-platform security hardening

#### **Infrastructure Validation**
- AWS resource auditing and cleanup
- System configuration validation
- Security baseline enforcement
- Compliance checking

#### **Cross-Platform Operations**
- Linux security hardening
- macOS security hardening
- Windows security hardening
- Consistent security policies across platforms

### ArgoCD

#### **Kubernetes Application Management**
- Application lifecycle management
- Version control and rollbacks
- Environment-specific configurations
- Dependency management

#### **GitOps Workflow**
- Continuous deployment from Git
- Automated sync and drift detection
- Application health monitoring
- Rollback capabilities

#### **Deployment Methods**
- **Helm Deployments**: Complex applications with templating
- **Kustomize Deployments**: Environment-specific overlays
- **Raw YAML**: Simple applications and configurations
