# Settings Fixed - Multiple Files Issue Resolved!

## âœ… **Root Cause Found**

The error was coming from **two different settings files**:
1. `.vscode/settings.json` (workspace settings)
2. `.nix/dotfiles/ide/settings.json` (Nix environment settings)

Both had conflicting gopls configurations with deprecated settings.

## ðŸ”§ **What I Fixed**

### **1. Updated `.nix/dotfiles/ide/settings.json`**
- Removed deprecated `ui.*` settings
- Added proper `gopls` configuration matching the working project
- Added `"serve"` argument to terraform-ls

### **2. Both Files Now Have Clean Configuration**
- No more deprecated settings
- Consistent gopls configuration
- Proper terraform-ls configuration

## ðŸ§ª **Test Now**

1. **Reload Window**: Command Palette â†’ "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Check for Errors**: The settings errors should be gone
3. **Test Both Languages**:
   - **Go**: Command-click should work
   - **Terraform**: Command-click should work (with "serve" argument)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

âœ… **No more settings errors**  
âœ… **Go**: Command-click navigation works  
âœ… **Terraform**: Command-click navigation works  
âœ… **Both language servers**: Should start properly  

## ðŸ’¡ **Why This Happened**

The Nix environment was loading its own settings file (`.nix/dotfiles/ide/settings.json`) which had the old, deprecated gopls configuration. This was conflicting with the workspace settings.

Now both files have clean, modern configurations that should work without errors!
